 package in the image anyway, remove httpd from busybox
 (Base system --> Configuration --> Networking Utilities --> httpd).
 Also you should take care for the initscripts, apache's httpd isn't
 compatible with the one from busybox, so if you want to use apache
 for running your webif, you'll need to change the parameters in the
 scripts and configure the rest in /etc/httpd.conf.

kmod-ucmb - 2.6.32.10-1 - The Microcontroller Message Bus is a tiny SPI-GPIO based communication
 channel used to talk to microcontrollers over GPIO pins.
 The lowlevel protocol is CRC16 protected, so one can be pretty sure
 that the data transmitted and received through the /dev/ucmb node is not corrupted.
 So no further checks should be needed at upper protocol layers.
 The device node considers every read/write to be one packet. The maximum packet
 size is either PAGE_SIZE (at least 4kb) or the microcontroller specific packet size
 limit, which is likely to be a lot smaller than PAGE_SIZE.
 To register an ucmb device, simply create a struct ucmb_platform_data
 and register it via ucmb_device_register() from another kernel module.
 Example implementations for the microcontroller-side code can be found in
 the utils/ucmb/microcontroller_examples subdirectory of the OpenWRT packages feed.

knock - 0.5-1 - It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface,
 looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client
 makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a
 port on the server. This port need not be open -- since

 even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server
 detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
 defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open
 up holes in a firewall for quick access.
 This package contains the port-knocking client.

 necessary to do string parsing in application code.
 
 Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared
 library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser
 library) and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes
 it well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

 software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are 
 some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, 
 parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
